# Pathfinding Visualier
This program visualises the processes used to find the optimal path between 2 points. 
Currently missing significant functionality, as it is in a development phase.

## Features

A variety of algorithms:
 - A* Search
 - Dijkstra's Algorithm - Unsupported
 - Depth-first Search - Unsupported
 - Swarm Algorithm - Unsupported
 - Bidirectional Swarm Algorithm - Unsupported
 - Convergent Swarm Algorithm - Unsupported

## Instructions

- Not enough functionality has been implemented for the need of menu instructions.
- Now, in its simplest state, your first click will assign the starting tile, second click will assign the end tile, and any following interactions will create obstacles. Right-clicking will clear a tile, and space bar will begin the pathfinding algorithm (selectable algorithm in the future, as of now only supports A*). 
- You are able to clear the grid by pressing 'C' at any time whilst the algorithm is not beinge executed.
