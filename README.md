# A* Algorithm Visualier
This program visualises the process used to find the optimal path between 2 points, using the A* pathfinding algorithm. 

## Instructions
- Download the files and run construct.py in your environment of choice.
- Clicking tiles on the grid will place objects. Your first click will place the starting point, the second your end point, and any further clicks will place obstacles.
- You can right-click tiles to clear them. To begin the program, press space bar.
- If you wish to clear the grid entirely, press C when the algorithm is not being executed.
